# Fast.ai CNN Image Recognition Project

## Introduction
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image recognition project using the fast.ai library. The goal is to train a model that can accurately classify images into resume and non-resume categories.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Net Imagedataset](http://www.image-net.org/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chaitalinaik/resume-and-non-resume-images), consisting of a collection of labeled images. This dataset was collated by me from the web.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chaitalivnaik/chaitali-bureau-assignment.git
   cd your-repository

2. Execute each code cell sequentially

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this model is able to classify images as resume and non resume with a high precision of 0.94
